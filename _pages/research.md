## Overview

My research focuses on developing novel evolutionary computation methods for feature selection in multi-label classification problems. I am particularly interested in sparsity-based approaches that can effectively reduce dimensionality while maintaining or improving classification performance.

## Current Research

### Evolutionary Computation for Multi-label Feature Selection

Multi-label classification problems, where instances can belong to multiple classes simultaneously, present unique challenges for feature selection. Traditional feature selection methods often fail to capture the complex label dependencies and feature-label relationships inherent in multi-label data.

My research investigates:
* **Genetic Programming approaches** for automated feature construction and selection
* **Particle Swarm Optimization** for efficient search in high-dimensional feature spaces
* **Sparsity-inducing methods** that promote minimal feature subsets
* **Multi-objective optimization** to balance feature subset size, classification accuracy, and computational efficiency

### Key Contributions

* Development of novel evolutionary algorithms specifically designed for multi-label feature selection
* Integration of sparsity constraints into evolutionary search processes
* Investigation of label dependency structures in feature selection
* Extensive experimental evaluation on benchmark datasets
* Comparative analysis with state-of-the-art methods

## Research Interests

* **Evolutionary Computation**: Genetic Programming, Particle Swarm Optimization, Genetic Algorithms, Differential Evolution
* **Machine Learning**: Multi-label Learning, Feature Selection, Dimensionality Reduction, Classification
* **Optimization**: Multi-objective Optimization, Combinatorial Optimization, Sparsity-based Methods
* **Data Mining**: Pattern Recognition, Knowledge Discovery, Big Data Analytics

## Collaborations

As a member of the Evolutionary Computation Research Group (ECRG) at Victoria University of Wellington, I collaborate with researchers and students working on various aspects of evolutionary computation and machine learning. Our group maintains strong connections with international research communities in computational intelligence.

## Future Directions

I am exploring several promising research directions:
* Deep learning integration with evolutionary feature selection
* Transfer learning approaches for multi-label problems
* Scalability improvements for very high-dimensional datasets
* Real-world applications in bioinformatics, text mining, and image recognition
* Explainable AI methods for feature selection interpretability
