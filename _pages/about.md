I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Victoria University of Wellington (VUW), specializing in Evolutionary Computation and Machine Learning. My research focuses on developing novel evolutionary algorithms for feature selection in multi-label classification problems, with particular emphasis on sparsity-based approaches.

## Research Interests

My primary research areas include:
* **Evolutionary Computation**: Genetic Programming, Particle Swarm Optimization, and other evolutionary algorithms
* **Machine Learning**: Multi-label classification, feature selection, and dimensionality reduction
* **Optimization**: Multi-objective optimization and sparsity-based methods

## Academic Background

I completed my Bachelor of Science (BSc) and BSc(Hons) 1st Class, both in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence, at Victoria University of Wellington in 2019 and 2020, respectively. I am an active member of the Evolutionary Computation Research Group (ECRG) at VUW, where I have contributed as the primary author of several peer-reviewed publications at international conferences.

## Professional Experience

Throughout my academic journey, I have served as a Head Tutor and Tutor for various courses in the School of Engineering and Computer Science at VUW, including:
* COMP307 (Machine Learning and Data Mining)
* COMP309 (Machine Learning Tools and Techniques)
* SWEN304 (Database System Engineering)
* COMP103 (Data Structures and Algorithms)
* COMP132 (Introduction to Computer Science)

I have also held research scholarships focusing on evolutionary computation applications in feature selection and classification problems.
