I am a Computer Science (AI) Ph.D. student at Victoria University of Wellington (VUW), School of Engineering and Computer Science (SECS), Wellington, New Zealand.\
My research focus is on Evolutionary Computation for Sparsity-based Feature Selection in Multi-label Classification. I hold a Bachelor of Science (BSc) and BSc(Hons) first class, both majoring in Computer Science (AI) from SECS, VUW.\
In addition, I am a student in the Evolutionary Computation Research Group (ECRG), in which I have several peer-reviewed publications at international conferences.
