## Experience

### AI & Data Engineer
**DataSing** | 2025 - Current

Lead end-to-end AI PoCs and MVP deliveries spanning frontend, backend, Azure provisioning, DevOps, and MLOps. Built agentic automation that reduced analytic turnaround from months to hours, delivered secure client LLM products in React/TypeScript and Streamlit on Azure, and designed ingestion pipelines with Infrastructure-as-Code and governance controls. Standardised internal frameworks for automated coding agents while owning client engagement, scoping, and senior stakeholder presentations.

### Data Analyst (AI & Strategic Projects Lead)
**Financial Intelligence Unit, New Zealand Police** | 2024 - 2025 (18 Months)

Prototyped LangChain and HuggingFace RAG solutions for legislative analysis, while leading large-scale ETL optimisation across mission-critical pipelines. Designed responsible AI governance frameworks, guided initiatives from business case to proof-of-concept via DataRobot, and regularly briefed governance boards. Developed ROI models for AI investment and brokered the FIU’s high-performance computing partnership with ESR.

### Senior Machine-Learning Researcher
**Victoria University of Wellington, School of Engineering and Computer Science** | 2021 - 2024 (Full Time)

Conducted state-of-the-art research in transformers, attention mechanisms, evolutionary optimisation, and disentangled representation learning for multi-label problems. Led entire research lifecycles—from hypothesis and experimentation to thesis delivery—published extensively in top venues, and contributed as an OpenReview discussant and journal reviewer.

### AI & Data Science Researcher (Contract)
**Victoria University of Wellington** | 2021 - 2024

Delivered applied AI research for multi-agency programmes, including genetic algorithm feature selection for marine biomass, and coordinated outputs across Callaghan Innovation and New Zealand Plant & Food Research.

### Head Graduate Teaching Assistant (Contract)
**Victoria University of Wellington** | 2020 - 2024

Managed and trained a cohort of 30+ tutors, standardised marking and teaching processes, and ensured consistent delivery across large-scale undergraduate papers.

### AI & Data Science Researcher (Contract)
**Victoria University of Wellington, School of Mathematics & Statistics** | 2018 - 2019

Produced statistical and data science analyses, implemented experimental methodologies, and supported research outputs across cross-disciplinary projects.

## Research Highlights

My research pairs theoretical guarantees with production-grade AI engineering, building trustworthy systems for high-stakes environments.

### Evolutionary Adversarial Training for Multi-Label Security (TEVC 2025)
Multi-label models carry real security risk when malicious actors tamper with co-occurring labels. I developed a CMA-ES driven adversarial training framework that operates in tabulated domains, crafting structured yet concealable perturbations without needing access to the target model. The many-objective formulation balances attack success (81–100% in evaluation), robustness, and stealth.

### Consistent Lebesgue Measure Multi-Label Learner (CLML)
Surrogate losses often undermine multi-label consistency. CLML maximises a Lebesgue hypervolume to align simultaneously with conflicting loss functions, delivering a provably consistent learner that still runs on lightweight feed-forward architectures. The approach outperforms graph-enhanced and perturbation-heavy baselines, showing that principled measure design can eclipse brute-force model complexity.

</div>
<p class="pdf-caption">Geometric interpretation of the Lebesgue measure maximisation that underpins CLML.</p>

#### Excerpts from the Consistency Proof
The key result links hypervolume maximisation to convergence towards Bayes predictors across three loss families:

<div class="equation">
$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} \lambda\big(H(F^{(n)}, R)\big) = \lambda\big(H(\mathbb{P}^{B}, R)\big) \implies \bigwedge_{v \in \{1,2,3\}} R_{\mathcal{L}_v}\big(f^{(n)}\big) \to R^{B}_{\mathcal{L}_v}(f).
$$
</div>

Pareto dominance ensures every non-Bayes solution is strictly outperformed along at least one loss surface:

<div class="equation">
$$
\forall i: L_i(f_\beta) \leq L_i(f_\gamma) \land \exists k: L_k(f_\beta) < L_k(f_\gamma), \quad f_\beta \in \mathbb{P}^{B},\; f_\gamma \notin \mathbb{P}^{B}.
$$
</div>

These theorems anchor the empirical findings and give decision-makers confidence that performance gains stem from sound statistical guarantees.
