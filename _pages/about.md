Welcome 
======
I am a Computer Science (AI) Ph.D. student at Victoria University of Wellington (VUW), School of Engineering and Computer Science (SECS), Wellington New Zealand. My research focus is on Evolutionary Computation for Sparsity-based Feature Selection in Multi-label Classification. I completed a Bachelor of Science (BSc) majoring in Computer Science at VUW, and later graduated with a BSc(Hons) first class in Computer Science (AI).
